## Pulls a random comic from XKCD and display it full screen.

I took a few minutes after class to create an app to display comics from the XKCD API call that we wrote in class. I modified it to pull a random comic from XKCD and display it full screen.

To run this app:

clone this repository
use Xcode to open the XKCD project
install on a device
